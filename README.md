# Dog Days Baseball

This is the official demo for Dog Days Baseball, a new tabletop baseball game. All of the pieces you need to play the game are below. Simply download the Guide, Charts, and Action Cards. Then choose the teams that you want to use. You will only need 2 d10 dice to play the game (along with the game components you downloaded).

There are two different options for each team. You can download all player cards in black and white or in color.

The purpose of this demo is to get feedback on the game play and any errors that needs to be corrected on the game pieces. That being said, I hope that you have fun, too :-) This is a new game still in development and your feedback is invaluable. Please email me at onbasebaseball@gmail.com with any feedback that you have. You can also find me on the usual forums under the handle "OnBase."
